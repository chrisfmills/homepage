## Trip Plan

## Day 1 (approach)
- left Victoria at 5am
- started hiking from car at 9am (exactly on time)
- at trailhead at 12:30
- at hut at 5pm (sunset)
- dinner at 6:30pm (mac'n cheese and lentil stew)

## Day 2 (peak day)
3 snowshoers (Torben/Bridget/Tim) went out for a day trip.

The snow was so icy that the skiers waited till the afternoon to do some laps behind the hut.

6:30pm dinner (chili)

## Day 3 (descent)
7am alarm, everyone moving by 7:30. We ate breakfast, cleaned the hut and were out the door by 9:30? leaving the hut in good shape for the next group.
Skiers scraped their way down on ice to the tree line (still fun), and snowshoers caught up as we were transitioning to bootpack down to the logging road.

Skiers transitioned between skiing and walking for the logging road, and made were on the rive by 1:20pm. Snowshoers at 2pm.

## Future Trip Edits
- ear plugs (in case of snoring)
- group luxuries enumerated
  - we packed 5.5L of red wine (a little much)
  - one DSL camera came up (good idea)
